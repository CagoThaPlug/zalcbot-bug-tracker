# ZalcBot Bug Tracker

This is the public place to report bugs or problems with ZalcBot. The ZalcBot bot itself is private and closed source, but this page lets anyone share issues they find while using it.

If something with ZalcBot is not working the way it should, you can open a new issue and tell us about it.

You can also see the board where we track bugs and what we are currently fixing.

Join the official ZalcBot Discord to get help or talk to the team:

## How to report a bug

1. Go to the Issues tab
2. Click on New Issue
3. Choose the bug report option
4. Fill out the form with details about the bug

Please explain what happened, what you expected, and how to make the bug happen again. The more detail you give, the easier it is for us to fix it.

## What this is for

This page is only for reporting problems and tracking bugs. It is not for asking for new features or requesting access to the bot.

If you have an idea for a new feature or want to talk about ZalcBot, please join the Discord instead.

Thanks for helping us improve ZalcBot
